##Password Vault Application
This Java project is a simple password vault application that allows users to store and retrieve passwords for various applications. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing to interact with the user.

##Features
Add a new password: Users can add a new password entry to the vault by providing the application name, username, and password.
Retrieve an old password: Users can retrieve previously saved passwords from the vault and view them in a table format.
Password protection: The vault is password-protected, and users need to provide the correct password to access its functionalities.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Any Java IDE or a command-line interface to compile and run the application.
Getting Started
Clone the project repository or download the source code files.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the App class to start the password vault application.
The application will prompt for the password to access the vault. Enter the correct password ("AHMED" in this case).
Once inside the vault, choose one of the following options:
To add a new password, enter 1 and fill in the required details in the GUI form.
To retrieve old passwords, enter 2, and a table will be displayed with previously saved passwords.
To quit the application, enter 3.
Upon exiting the application, any new passwords added will be saved to a file named help.csv.
